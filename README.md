# React-Portfolio

## Description

This was a great opportunity to showcase what we have learned when it came to using React coding. We were able to translate earlier work we had done with HTML and CSS into a new language and bring familiar elements to the forefront in new ways! This project also allows us to showcase how far we have come since our first project refactoring and showcasing a static HTML website. This portfolio will be a great jumping off point to showcase our future endeavors and work as a "sizzle-reel" in helping attract future employers to our bodies of work. This project allows us to show the fruit of our Bootcamp labor in the form of homeworks and Projects put on display for others to see and enjoy. I learned a lot about coding in React as well as how the .jsx extension works with vite and building a JavaScript website using new nomenclature like className.

## Installation

First you must go to [Github](www.github.com) and open the repository.
![Github Pages](./React-Portfolio/src/assets/images/GithubPages.png) 

From there you can download and clone the code and open it in the browser of your choice.

![Github Code](./React-Portfolio/src/assets/images/GithubCode.png)

Open the code in the code editor of your choice and then install all the npm packages with the command `npm i`. After all the packages have loaded, you will need to run the server npm command `npm run dev`. That will spin up the website and bring you to the about page.

## Usage

The webpage should load automatically to the About page.

## Credits

I would like to thank the staff from the UCLA Bootcamp as well as the students who helped me understand the code when I got to difficult spots. I also appreciate the assistance of the X-Pert Learner software which helped me catch small mistakes and help me form syntax for some of the trickier bits of coding.
